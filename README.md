# CollabDoc

# Problem Statement

There are a lot of times, when doctors are not able to diagnose a patient correctly, or treatment of the patient is not possible due to insufficient access to equipments and specialists, or most importantly doctors are unsure/cannot figure out what plan of action has to be undertaken when faced with an ambiguable decisions with patients. Motivation ----> Diagnoses that are missed, incorrect or delayed are believed to affect 10 to 20 percent of cases, far exceeding drug errors and surgery on the wrong patient or body part, both of which have received considerably more attention. [1]

Well ever wonder efficient collaboration between doctors living at distant places, one that would reduce chances of doctors to wrongfully diagnosing you, one that would help you get blood/other organs on time, or one that would help you get the right treatment?

To solve this problem, we would be creating a web portal called Collab Doc which would further enable peer-to-peer discussion enabling knowledge sharing among the stakeholders, ultimately resulting in better clinical decisions from hospitals and doctors of small clinics alike and hence saving more lives.

# Basic Idea

The basic idea is to create a web portal, which is going to be a place where a doctors of various specialisations can interact. The signup process would both be for Doctors and Hospitals alike where they can Whenever there is an issue, the doctors can interact with each other, and get each otherâ€™s opinions.

To make collaboration efficient, we would be asking the specialisation of doctors first and store it in a tag. Doctors having similar tags on question and answers discussion is the key idea to sorting on what doctors are most capable to answer and doctors getting answers to their questions faster.

We believe that our idea would also solve more more major problem in the distant future - Doctors uploading the X- Ray/MRI scan/any other results online to discuss patient history would indirectly lead to modernsiation of healthcare industry wherein nowadays they are only being stored in older methods like CDs or only in some cases the private networks of hospitals. As we improve in this respect doctors can see old patient records relevant to their field and in turn be updated on relevant discussions and developments in their own field.

Also now coming to sharing of resources, the implementation part comes in that if there is a specific type of blood, or any other resources required at a particular hospital, and the same is available at another, the website will alert the two hospitals, and the resources can reach where and when required.

To conclude, the future scope of our project is well defined in the motto Healthcare Collaboration in the 21st century
